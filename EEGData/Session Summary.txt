1) Description of stimulus conditions.

Three types of stimuli were presented: 

Original 2D images (n=30), 
Enhanced versions (DMD algorithm, n=30)
3D versions of the same images (n=30) 

These three types of images were presented as pairs of images of the same scene. 

Condition 1 Enhanced then Original Ñ Enhanced version of scene was shown first, Original version of the scene was shown second. 

Condition 2 Enhanced then Stereo Ñ Enhanced version of scene was shown first, Stereo version of the scene was shown second. 

Condition 3 Original then Enhanced Ñ Original version of scene was shown first, Enhanced version of the scene was shown second. 

Condition 4 Original then Stereo Ñ Original version of scene was shown first, Stereo version of the scene was shown second. 

Condition 5 Stereo then Enhanced Ñ Stereo version of scene was shown first, Enhanced version of the scene was shown second. 

Condition 6 Stereo then Original Ñ Stereo version of scene was shown first, Original version of the scene was shown second. 


2)Trial description.

For each trial two different versions of the same scene were used, we will refer to them as First Image and Second Image.
Each trial lasts 2 seconds(2000 msec). 
 
[0, 500 msec] Ñ displayed a black screen with the fixation cross.
[501 msec, 1000 msec] Ñ displayed the First Image with the fixation cross. 
[1001 msec, 1500 msec] Ñ displayed a black screen with the fixation cross.
[1501 msec, 2000 msec] Ñ displayed the Second Image with the fixation cross. 


The order of the conditions was randomized. Each of the 30 scenes in each condition was shown twice.Scene list1 mb_rocks12 mb_playtable3 mb_recycle4 mb_cloth5 mb_playroom6 mb_art7 mb_cable8 mb_classroom9 mb_sticks10 mb_rocks211 mb_shelves12 mb_pipes13 mb_piano14 mb_books15 mb_monopoly16 mb_mask17 mb_bicycle18 mb_backpack19 mb_sword220 mb_laundry21 mb_flowerpots22 mb_moebius23 mb_motorcycle24 mb_sword125 mb_umbrella26 mb_aloe27 mb_adirondack28 mb_bowling29 mb_vintage30 mb_dolls
